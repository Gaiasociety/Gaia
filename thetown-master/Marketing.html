					We created 2 videos and 6 photos for our campaign. Our only platform used was Instagram as that most aligned to our target persona. Through the use of short mesmerizing videos and bold pictures of intriguing people where hashtags were the main form of communication, we caught people's attention. We promoted creativity, stepping out of one's comfort zone and being openminded.

                  Through short phrases such as the one pictured here, we intended to encourage and coax people to be open minded and think outside of the box.

            <p>
		    We learned that consistency is key and that tight scheduling involving our social media campaign are important to reach the biggest possible audience. We didn't expect the lack of interaction. Our brand would thrive more if people engaged and shared our tags online. We did expect that gaining a follower base would take time and that it would grow gradually. Unfortunately we did not reach 100 followers by 14th of April as our objective had stated. We also should have used instagram's story function more often to reach out.&nbsp; </p>

          <h4 class="text-center tm-text-primary mb-4">Future planning</h4>
          <p>
			  Overall, we believe our campaign could have been stronger. While our messages that are brought via the posts is clear, we need to focus on using our story function more as well as more consistent posting. In the future, we might opt for a different strategy where we could share more background information about the origin of the sweaters and the design that is made by our local artists. 
			  For now we want to continue this posting schedule for 2 more weeks, with 6 more promotional pictures and 2 promotional videos. In 2 weeks we will check if our objectives and goal will have been reached. If not the case, we will opt for a different strategy as mentioned before, with a more consistent schedule and different approach to what we will post. On top of that, after 2 weeks we want to open a secondary social media account on Tiktok as this will also align with our target audience. Through the use of short videos we will want to dive into the background of our company more and be transparent about the manufacturing of our sweaters. This will be mostly informative content as well as challenges to engage more.

            In short, our social media posts were created to share our brand vision and values in mind. With the use of big bold hashtags we wanted to reach out and grab our audience's attention and make them think. We incorporated our signature blue and pink colours in the photo posts and used unique, non conventional music to attract people's attention and keep it focused on us. Inbetween we also shared pictures of our models sporting two of our sweater lines. One is the pastel line with green, pink and purple as options. This pastel line was created to embrace one's creative mind. The second line is the classic line which contains black, white and grey options. These neutral colours are perfect to be both subtle yet bold. Both lines have variations of the GAIA logo either on the front or back, either in colour or monochrome. As these are our first two clothing lines, we want to promote our name and design first and foremost. The pictures and videos are to be found if you go to GAIA's landing page and go to the 'about us' section. There you can click on the link to visit the gallery and see both the videos and pictures used. The pictures of the models that wear our sweaters can be found under the catalogue subheading on the main landing page. Our Instagram page is also very visibly linked under the 'about us' subheading.
